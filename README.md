### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My currently working role: UCF CWEP @ LOCKHEED MARTIN, MISSILES AND FIRE CONTROL, part of the Engineering Process Improvement team.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a Computer Science major at the University of Central Florida, with minors in Data Science and Mathematics.
- ðŸŒ± I enjoy exploring the intersection of computing, data, and logicâ€”leveraging analytical thinking to solve real-world problems.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I hold a Black Belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, where mental strategy meets physical precision.
